Subject: [Ethercatmaster-users]  some questions about the usage of eml
Message-ID: <OF7BC88885.34F35113-ONC125757B.004CB5DF-C125757B.004DB695@datacon.at>



Hi,

I use the eml on a linux machine (with xenomai and rtnet) and want to
coummunicate with my slave.
The slave is a NXSTK 50-RE with a netx50 cpu (
http://de.hilscher.com/products_details_hardware.html?p_id=P_47614930462d6)
.
The configuration of the slave is known by the master (i added a entry to
the slave db from the xml-file).
I connected the slave and the master directly with a TP Cat5 cable.
When I run the master_test application the slave is found in the ring but
the state will not be changed (from init to op state).
EC_ESM_OPS::set_state():state trans. failed...


so where is the mistake?

Regards
Henning

If you want some help, you will have to provide more information I'm afraid.
What does your debugger say, what happens if you try to go to pre-operational, ...

Hi,

that happens if i try to set the slave to op-state (this also happens if i
try pre-op-state):

   ethercat at rd-ethercat:/usr/src/eml/eml-trunk$ sudo
   tests/rtnet/master_test rteth0
   Socket created: socket id: 896
   Got interface: index: 0

   Master initializing

If i set the slave to the init state (as it should be) everything goes
fine.

   ethercat at rd-ethercat:/usr/src/eml/eml-trunk$ sudo
   tests/rtnet/master_test rteth0
   Socket created: socket id: 896

   Getting slave handler2
   Setting NETX50 to INIT State
   NETX50 successfully set in INIT State
   AL initializing

   Test: Set Channel 1 to 5V:

   Test done.


The two attachements (hope that will work) show the debug prints of the
makefile and a part of the source code.
Hope that helps.

(See attached file: sourcecode.doc)(See attached file: make.doc)

Henning

Can you step through the program with your debugger, and see what line fails exactly?

Do you also have problems with other devices, or just this one (I'm not familiar with this one).  If this is the only one, does the manual say something about extra configuration steps which have to be taken?

Please don't put text output in MS word files (even more: don't use MS word files on public mailinglists).

Hi Klaas,

I switched from the Hilscher device to some beckhoff devices and everything
went well.
