Hi,

I am a bit concerned that it is not possible to run two NICs whereby the 
one will be real-time and the other not.

This is the stop script given by EML.

/usr/local/rtnet/sbin/rtifconfig rtlo down
/usr/local/rtnet/sbin/rtifconfig rteth0 down
rmmod rt_loopback
rmmod rt_8139too
rmmod rtpacket
rmmod rtnet


This is the start script
rmmod 8139too
mknod /dev/rtnet c 10 240
insmod /usr/local/rtnet/modules/rtnet.ko
insmod /usr/local/rtnet/modules/rtpacket.ko
insmod /usr/local/rtnet/modules/rt_loopback.ko
insmod /usr/local/rtnet/modules/rt_8139too.ko
/usr/local/rtnet/sbin/rtifconfig rtlo up
/usr/local/rtnet/sbin/rtifconfig rteth0 up


If I have two cards with realtek chip how can I ensure one is still 
accessible for normal non-realtime traffic?

Kidn regards,

Roland Tollenaar

no need to be concerned, since it IS possible :o)

Using the module parameter "cards". It accepts an array of zeros and
ones. e.g.: insmod rt_8139too.ko cards=0,1,0 will use the "middle" card
of 3.

So the workflow is to first load the RTnet module with the cards
parameter and then the normal 8139too module which will take whatever
cards are left.

If the first is realtek and the other has another chip. If I don;t 
unload the module for the second chip then I presume that it will remain 
functional as a normal ethrnet interface?

Kind regards,
