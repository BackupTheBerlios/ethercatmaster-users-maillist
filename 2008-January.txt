Subject: [Ethercatmaster-users] Using EL6731 Profibus-Slave with EML
Message-ID: <07DEA4D856F65840BE7D961177B59E8409FF1D@xantippe.scansonic.de>

Hi there, 

i try to use a Beckhoff EL6731 to communicate with a Profibus-Network. So i have to change some Profibus-settings of the module such as station-address, baudrate, etc. Unfortunately i have no idea how to do this :( Are there any eml-methods to do this?? 
Any information would be appreciated! 

Thanks in advance, 
Joern

I try to do the same at the moment. 

We have to complete the CoE implementation. Then you can configure the EL6731
parameters via CANopen over EtherCAT.

I have prototyped some frames (according to EtherCAT Spec and reverse
engineered with TwinCAT and wireshark) but i am actually not able to get
a useful response from the EtherCAT Terminal.

Hello Manuel,

thank you for responding. It is the scary answer i almost expected;) So i think there's a bit of work to do and i have to get confident with CoE.

Regards,
Joern
