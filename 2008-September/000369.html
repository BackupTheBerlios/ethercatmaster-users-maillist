<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>In 2006, The Flanders' Mechatronics Technology Centre (FMTC) made an
implementation of the EtherCAT master protocol (further on this
implementation is reffered to as EML).  FMTC, copyright holder of EML,
intended to release this software as open source software under the
GPL or LGPL license.  Since the EtherCAT technology is protected by
patents, FMTC contacted Beckhoff Automation before releasing the
source code as open source software.

Beckhoff was willing to license the EtherCAT technology and trade name
free of charge to FMTC, however they were also concerned to keep the
&quot;EtherCAT Masters&quot; in the market using the tradename &quot;EtherCAT&quot; and
not being fully compatible any longer with the latest version of
EtherCAT specification and technology down to a minimum number.  The
(L)GPL does not offer a mechanism for such a protection, and therefore
an extra license agreement (EtherCAT Master License Agreement),
proposed by Beckhoff, was added to the (L)GPL.  The EtherCAT Master
License Agreement is a peer-to-peer license between the user of EML
(Licensee) and Beckhoff and assures that the right to use EtherCAT
Technology is granted and comes free of charge under condition of
compatibility of product made by Licensee.

Recently, FMTC has been informed by Beckhoff that there is a possible
conflict between statements in the EtherCAT Master License Agreement
and the (L)GPL.

Until this situation has been fully cleared out:
- FMTC will remove the EML sources from the public server at
   &lt;<A HREF="http://ethercatmaster.berlios.de">http://ethercatmaster.berlios.de</A>&gt;
- FMTC advises current EML users to contact Beckhoff before continuing
   development based on EML.

We are actively working on a new license that will solve the issue
and hope the situation is cleared out quickly.  FMTC's (and
Beckhoff's) objectives remain the same as in 2006, and therefore FMTC
has no intention to take the EML sources away permanently.

Best regards,

Klaas Gadeyne
