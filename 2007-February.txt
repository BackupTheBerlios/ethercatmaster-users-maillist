Currently, this is done manually (see the included test programs in
SVN).  Configuration data are fetched from twincat.  It would be nice
if there would be an ethercat slave XML database available from
Beckhoff including all possible slave data which could be parsed and
converted then.
See <http://ethercatmaster.berlios.de/doxygen/html/todo.html> for this
one and more todo's and feel free to provide patches :-)
This is (or was at the time I mainly wrote the code) not the case.

We have no plans in that direction.
