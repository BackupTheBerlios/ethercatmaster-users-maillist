I once had a private conversation with somebody (he was Dutch too) who had already done it and told me it was a minor effort.  Unfortunately, it was never contributed back and I don't know whether he's subscribed to the mailinglist.

The port above was non-realtime IIRC.

Hi Klaas,

Thanks. I'll look into porting EML ourselves then.

Kind regards,

Roland.

I had some for the ecos port (not using sockets) before it was migrated to Berlios, but that seems to be lost (ie. I deleted the old repository here :-(.
AFAIS, the closest shot is to use the DLL directly, see <http://ethercatmaster.berlios.de/doxygen/html/classEtherCAT__DataLinkLayer.html>

Your patches are very welcome :-)

Sorry. No Problem.

Aahh! What a pity!

Thanks but afraid this does not help. I am trying to find out what the 
ethernet frames look like just before they are sent. In the code where 
we use the EML we do work directly with the dll. Unless I am 
misunderstanding you entirely.

What, to make the EML more instructive? I presume the EML was not 
written to be instructive rather than effective, flexible etc. Which I 
will presume it to be.

I just want to see how best to connect to a slave in a straightforward 
frame x frame manner. And do some simple tests. Guess I'll have to do 
this the hard way. Glory be, why does Beckhoff not jsut simply supply a 
neat C++ API for their equipment :(

Thanks anyway.

Regards,

Roland.

Subject: [Ethercatmaster-users] EtherCAT Distributed Clocks --> line delay
	calculation
Message-ID: <48908A0B.8080106@numalliance.com>

Hello,

I'm working on the implementation of the DCs on an Ethercat Master.
There is an ambiguous calculation... According to the EtherCAT spec :

    linedelay = [( port time difference - execution delays - port delays
    ) - DelayAA of next slave] / 2.
    DelayAA : time the frames needs to enter Port 0 and leave Port 0 on
    the way back. E.g. if Port 0 and Port 1 are in use :
    DelayAA = Receive Port Delay of Port 0 + Execution Delay +
    TimeDifference (BA) + Port Delay Transmit of Port 0
    BA = Receive Time on Port 1 - Receive Time on Port 0

    * Can anyone please explain to me the subtle difference between
      "execution delays" and "Execution Delay".
    * I'd also like to know what the spec means with "port delays" ?
          o Is that the time each port need to transmit the frame ?
          o Is that the sum of the delays of all ports ?
          o Is that the transmission delay between the two ports ? (i.e
            a delay due to the electronics components)
          o Or it's rather the delays' sum of the 2 ports used in this
            calculation ?

Best regards,
Thibaut BOYER

Hmm, I only have V1.00 of the spec at hand here, and I can't find the stuff your referring to?
