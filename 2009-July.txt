Subject: [Ethercatmaster-users] Number of Mailboxes
Message-ID: <OFA34378DA.C475A3D9-ONC12575FA.00263FC7-C12575FA.0027A343@datacon.at>


Hi list,

in the current version of the EML the number of mailboxes is limited to 2.
Was there a special reason why this was hard-coded into the EML ?

In the ETG Sepcs the example configurations are always with 2 mailbox and 2
process data configurations.
Thus SM0 and SM1 are used for the mailbox configuration and SM2 and SM3 for
process data configuration.

Theroretically there are up to 16 SyncManagers in one slave and we are
going to try set up 4 mailboxes (one slave that controls 2 axes => 2
mailboxes for each axes).
Actually I am waiting for an answer from Beckhoff if this is generally
possible ( I guess it should.).

Moreover, I will take care of the implementation of more than 2 Mailboxes
in a dynamic way.

Cheers
Henning
