The port has mainly been done by a master student (in cc:) . The 0.1
version of the source code was portable so the xenomai port was not
that hard, however the build system used must be revamped completely
to get the ethercat stack out of the ecos tree.

I have currently succeeded to recompile the ethercat source tree,
using the cmake build system.   It is set up in a way that should also
make it possible to integrate the xenomai port fairly easy.  You can
find it in the subversion tree of eml
<https://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=6087>.  However, this is
not yet well tested at all, and the ecos specific stuff is still in
the eCos tree (and will probably remain there!
Tom is studying for his exams now, and will start integrating his
sources into the berlios svn tree in february I guess.  I don't have
the sources here, so you'll have to ask him.

ps.  This reminds me of the fact that the news item should have
appeared on the devel mailinglist, but for some reason it did not come
through.  So for the record:
<https://developer.berlios.de/forum/forum.php?forum_id=23791>
ps2.  Please redirect follow up posts to ethercatmaster-users
Mailinglist only (so I don't have to put
allinterestedpeople at thewholeworld.com in cc :-)

Subject: [Ethercatmaster-users] EML License
Message-ID: <5B8954B873BFEF47949A325CD895B87F01EF8187@mecoms1.MECO-AD.LOCAL>

Hello all,

 

The EML is distributed under the GPL license. Furthermore, the Ethercat
Master license is in effect.

However, every sourcefile states: "You can use "EtherCAT Master Library"
for creating and/or selling or otherwise distributing an EtherCAT
network master under the terms of the EtherCAT Master License."

 

When a commercial product makes use of the EML and an EtherCat Master
License has been signed, should the product's sourcecode be published
under GPL, or can it just link against the EML without disclosing the
code? (Like Xenomai which uses the LGPL for headers in user space).

 

Thanks,  

 

Ivo Pullens

Hi Ivo,

The EtherCAT Master License states that EML source code may be licensed 
against either GPL or L-GPL. The code that is available for download from 
the website is licensed against GPL. In case you use that codebase for a 
commercial product, you're right, you are obliged to release your 
application code under GPL also. If you are interested in an L-GPL version 
of the same codebase, this can be discussed. I think that we better keep 
that disussion off-list though.
Hope this clarifies things a little,

Bob
