<PRE>Hello everyone,

I think indeed the possibility to use 2 nic's is only offered by the realtek cards. 
That's the reason why I decided to use the serial line for debugging and a Intel
nic a EtherCAT master (as Klaas Gadeyne also sugested).

But when I try to build a redboot bootdisk I get errors again :-( 

/ecos-c/cygwin/home/Administrator/eml-0.1/test/library/rb_intel3/redboot_install
/lib/libtarget.a(io_eth_eth_drv.o): In function `eth_drv_dsr':
/home/Administrator/ecos/packages/io/eth/current/src/stand_alone/eth_drv.c:551:
undefined reference to `start_console'
/home/Administrator/ecos/packages/io/eth/current/src/stand_alone/eth_drv.c:551:
undefined reference to `end_console'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[1]: *** [/ecos-c/cygwin/home/Administrator/eml-0.1/test/library/rb_intel3/r
edboot_install/bin/redboot.elf] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/Administrator/eml-0.1/test/library/rb_intel3/r
edboot_build/redboot/current'
make: *** [build] Error 2


I tried different things. Because I don't want to use the nic for redboot debugging, 
my first guess was that disabling Redboot Networking is enough to get it working. 
This wasn't the case, so I also disabled Ethernet port 0 driver (under common ethernet 
support -&gt; pc board ethernet driver). Because this also failed in combination with an 
Intel card I tried it also with a realtek. This also gives the same result.

Only when I only change start-up type from grub to floppy and change nothing else
I'm able to boot redboot (of course it says no network card found). When I change the
same configuration to an Intel card, I can make a bootdisk, but when I load it I only
get 2,5 rows of dots and a blinking cursor. All other things I tried (as explained above)
don't succeed in building a bootdisk.

Can someone give me a hint how to get it working? It can be not that difficult to get it
working I think, but I still didn't succeed to build eCos for my hardware.

Thanks in advance,
Jeroen

No problem of cource :-) I must admit I read the disclamer yesterday for the first 
time.

I don't think this problem is related to our changes.  I just had a
look to the cdl logic of the different ethernet drivers, and it seems
like only the (cdl logic of the?) rltk8139 driver allows to have multiple
cards.  Maybe the rltk8139 driver is the only eCos driver that allows
for multiple cards?  You better check this on the eCos ML though.

btw, you could of course use the serial line for debugging, that seems
to me like the easiest workaround in the short term.

After reading your disclaimer, I _do_ hope I did not abusively
received your email :-)
