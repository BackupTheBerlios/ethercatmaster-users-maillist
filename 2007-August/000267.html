Hmm, this doesn't convince me yet. Such skews during startup may as well
be triggered by unusual load during runtime (non-RT activity or new RT
components). Did you put your system under adequate non-RT load as well
while measuring the outputs?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will keep the check disabled but for the EML chaps I do think this is
</I>&gt;<i> a point of interest. I would be very interested how this index shift
</I>&gt;<i> occurs and why it is persistent after occurring once.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for the pragmatic qualifications here but in the end its the
</I>&gt;<i> stability of the outputs that will determine the behaviour of the
</I>&gt;<i> machine so its not a bad way to assess the software. :)
</I>
A problem isn't solved until it is also understood.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If the problem persists (or your _really_ want to understand what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> happens), you could try to put an xntrace_user_freeze(0, 1) before the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> line which emits that EML warning, turn on the I-pipe tracer, set a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> large back_trace_points value (a few thousand), enable verbose mode, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> grab what /proc/ipipe/trace/frozen reports after the hick-up. See [1]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for more howtos.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Done this before so it should not be a problem. Don't think it is
</I>
In that case, I would even more suggest to collect the data, maybe now
about the fragile startup case.

&gt;<i> necessary quite yet as the behaviour at the moment looks good.
