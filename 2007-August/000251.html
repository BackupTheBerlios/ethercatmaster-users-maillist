<PRE>Hi

&gt;&gt;<i> RTnet:rtskb allocation from real-time cache failed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Assertion failed! drivers/xenomai/can/rtcan_raw.c: rtcan_tx_push:168 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dev-&gt;tx_socket=0 (3) TX skb still in use.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hm, this is not supposed to happen.
</I>Which of the two?


&gt;<i> Can you show the output of /proc/rtcan/devices and /proc/rtcan/sockets 
</I>&gt;<i> before and after the problem showed up.
</I>
Below is an accumulation of what I think you are asking for. I am not 
convinced that the rtskb allocation failed message is serious, as you 
will see from the syslog and my comment above it only takes place when i 
close my application. Although I try to close all connections neatly 
certain threads still seem to be busy. See the errors I get on closing 
the application.

App running with no problem:

cat /var/syslog shows that the error only seems to come up when the 
application closes.

Only occurs on closing the application

When I close the application I get these errors

Does this shed any light on the matter?
