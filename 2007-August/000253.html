<PRE>Hi Wolfgang,

&gt;<i> The RTCAN assertion. Well, in fact, it can happen when the device goes 
</I>&gt;<i> bus-off or is stopped while a TX message is pending. The next message 
</I>&gt;<i> after (re-)start will the trigger this message. This is a bug but it 
</I>&gt;<i> should _not_ harm (either I remove the assertion or I reset properly the 
</I>&gt;<i> value of dev-&gt;tx_socket).
</I>Clear. Thanks.


&gt;<i> The first one should be pretty clear. The rtskb pool seems to be exhausted.
</I>Sorry if this is not clear to me. What is the rtskb pool and what are 
the implications of it being full?

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Oops, that much errors?
</I>eeuuh yes, I started up can after having had it disabled for a very long 
time while I was working on the ethercat. I seem to have forgotten that 
CAN is not wireless, forgot to plug in the bus. So I think that those 
errors were picked up then, they did not seem to increase later on.


&gt;&gt;<i> rt_dev_recv: aborted because socket was closed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rt_dev_recv: aborted because socket was closed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rt_dev_recv: aborted because socket was closed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rt_dev_recv: aborted because socket was closed
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You should handle this error properly.
</I>You are right. I think I am not closing the threads in the correct 
sequence, not sure I know how to yet. But can this be the cause of my 
problem? Where is the conflict/ complication arising between rtcan and 
eml. I do understand that this is an almost impossible question to find 
an answer to over two separate lists. :(


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hm, seems that your shutdown is not implemented properly.
</I>I'd say this assessment is rather accurate. Will look into it:)

Roland
