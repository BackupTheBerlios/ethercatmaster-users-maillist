[Tom, correct me if I'm wrong here]

I haven't sorted it out yet, but it shouldn't.  IIRC Tom's original
implementation didn't contain the while loop in the txandrx call
(grrrrrr, berlios still down).  Again, IIRC, he added it, because
sometimes, during initialization (typically not done in a periodic
thread), when frames got lost, EML just gave up completely.  Now,
since this happened at a couple of places, he decided to put the while
loop in the lower level txandrx code, instead of in several places in
the higher level layers during initialization.

Now, as explained in my previous message, when running this code in a
periodic thread (when all stuff is in its operational state), things
might go wrong when a message arrives after the timeout [*] due to
a) You can have a periodic thread with a period smaller than the
maxtries cycle it takes, which messes things up.
b) the fact that the lock is in (and not around) the while loop.

It seems to me (but I cannot conclude this 100% sure from what Roland
reports) that somehow this scenario occurs:
1/ tries = 0 A first frame is sent out
2/ Somehow, this frame gets delayed more than the timeout [again *]
3/ tries = 1 A second frame (identical to the first one) is sent out
4/ The first frame has arrived back meanwhile and is captured by the
    recv call (no error since they are identical), all seems well.
5/ tries = 0 A third frame (different from the first two) is sent out
6/ The recv call get the second frame back, detects the index is
    wrong, and drops it.

So, ATM I don't think we need another lock, but we (or someone else :)
should get the above behaviour fixed first.
Somehow (I think this is rather related to a) above) this gets solved
(I noticed that my original reasoning about the priorities was not
correct since I hadn't seen the timeout on the socket then) by
altering the priorities, but I think that is not the basic problem here.

Roland, what happens if you simply remove the while loop (make sure to
put EtherCAT logging to verbose mode)?

[*] Somebody should reread the docu in the spec about transmission
rates/times...
