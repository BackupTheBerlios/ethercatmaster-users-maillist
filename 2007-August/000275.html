Probably something like this happens: One frame somehow gets lost
(wireshark should confirm this), the next txandrx happens before the
timeout of the first txandrx, and the first txandrx accepts a message
that it shouldn't be accepting.

HOWEVER, if you look at the txandrx code I copy pasted in a previous
mail (berlios seems to be down), you can see that this shouldn't be
happening since Tom apparently uses a _global_ lock for this, unless I
overlook something (which is probably the case)...

So, given the implementation with the global lock (one can discuss
whether it's optimal, feel free to provide a patch) I don't understand
how this happens.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// For thread safety: txandrx() can be called from multiple threads...
static pthread_mutex_t txandrx_mut;

static bool ec_rtdm_txandrx(struct EtherCAT_Frame * frame, struct
netif * netif) {
         int tries = 0;
         while (tries &lt; MAX_TRIES_TX) {
                 pthread_mutex_lock (&amp;txandrx_mut);
                 if (low_level_output(frame,netif)){
                         if (low_level_input(frame,netif)){
                                 pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;txandrx_mut);
                                 return true;
                         }
                         else{
                                 //log(EC_LOG_ERROR,
 				&quot;low_level_txandrx: receiving
 				failed\n&quot;);
                                 pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;txandrx_mut);
                         }
                 }
                 else{
                         //log(EC_LOG_ERROR, &quot;low_level_txandrx:
 			sending failed\n&quot;);
                         pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;txandrx_mut);
                 }
                 tries++;
         }
         log(EC_LOG_FATAL, &quot;low_level_txandrx: failed: MAX_TRIES_TX:
 	Giving up\n&quot;);
         return false;
}
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Unless of course (thinking doesn't hurt), I think other problems could occur
with this implementation.

[I've only had a short look at Tom's code, so feel free to correct
me...]
   Since the locking of the mutex happens inside the while loop, this
   construction seems not particularly threadsafe.  If I look at the
   implementation of low_level_input(), the receiving part on the raw
   socket is implemented like this:

   int len_recv = recv(sock,buffer_receive,sizeof(buffer_receive),0);

   Looking at the top of the driver file, the socket timeout is set to

// Maximum tries to send and receive a message
#define MAX_TRIES_TX 10
// Timeout for receiving and transmitting messages is 10ms
#define TIMEOUT_NSEC 1000 * 100

   [I think s/10ms/100us/g]

   while you're are trying to send at a 1ms period.  So IMO this can
   cause race conditions...

   - Thread sends message, frame somehow gets lost, but timeout is set to
   100 us
   - After 1 ms, thread is woken up again, tries to send msg (should
   fail since mutex is locked).

   I can't predict exactly what will be happening, but by just looking
   at the code, I would say, this ain't gonna work...

Does your problem also occur, if your PD thread only sends at a 2ms
rate (or if you decrease MAX_TRIES_TX to 5 for instance)

Not a plain simple printf() I might hope?
