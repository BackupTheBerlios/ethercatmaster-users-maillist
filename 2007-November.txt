Yes, IIRC I already had a private email conversation in the past with somebody
which has it done already.  Never saw code though.  I don't know if
he follows this mailing list and is willing to share his code?

We never really went "all the way", but we have given demos using
xenomai with a PDO cycle of 10 kHz.
It's been a very long time since we've used the eCos port, but given
appropriate hardware, that should work on eCos too.

There is no XML parsing in the code currently, and if there would be
(there have been some mails on the mailing list about this, but again,
we never saw code), it would be on master side

Yes.

I think I don't understand your question here.  It implements only
master functionality and respects the standard, so it's not coupled to
(ethercat) firmware.

> 6. Are there any special HAL support for specific Ethernet chips?

We rely on HAL support from
- available ethernet HW drivers in the eCos project for eCos
- available ethernet HW drivers from the RTnet project for Xenomai

So it's the OS that delivers us the network drivers.

What exactly is unclear about it?

FMTC is currently not actively working on the project anymore (we do
use the code in some of our projects ourselves).
The source code is there for the community to use (and improve).

Message-ID: <1194042042.23107.8.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Hello Harti,

I saw your post that the rtnet (0.99) was testes and worked on a xenomai
platform (2.30). EML is compiled and installed.

Could you send me some steps about the EML compilation and installing,
testing RTnet?
I'm using linux kernel 2.6.22.10, xenomai 2.4-rc5, rtnet trunk 1139, and
EML 0.1.

Thanks in advance,
Dennis

Hello,

Can EML be configured and built as a slave?
Can EML Master communicate with another Master.

Thanks in advance,

EML = ethercat MASTER library

AFAIK "There can be only one."

Hello all,

I'm using linux i386 kernel 2.6.22-12,
adeos-ipipe-2.6.22-i386-1.10-12.patch, xenomai-2.4-rc6, rtnet trunk 1140
as 11/15/2007, eml trunk 31 as of 11/15/2007.
Beckhoff EL1100, and one EL2004.
I didn't use the El4102. I modified the master_test.cpp using Tom and
Haris example for EL2004. I set EtherCAT_SlaveDb::instance(2).
there are 2 RTL 8139 on the PC.

I inserted modules:
sudo mknod /dev/rtnet c 10 240
sudo ifconfig eth0 down
sudo ifconfig eth1 down

I got the error messages when running the master_test:

There are 20 frames capture while I ran the master_test. The following
are 2 of the frames.

I got this from dmesg:

Xenomai: xnintr_shirq_handler: IRQ11 not handled: Disable IRQ line.

I don't know if the xenomai disable IRQ line caused EML couldn't receive
the reply.

Any suggestion to solve the master initiation please.

Thanks in advance,

Hi Dennis,

If this NIC you are using with rtnet is on IRQ line 11 then it will most 
certainly not work.

you still have an IRQ conflict in this case.

Hi Roland,

You're right.  The issue related to IRQ.  I don't know how to turn on or 
off the IRQ.  I'm using other card which has IRQ 10.

Thanks,

Subject: [Ethercatmaster-users] configuration & NOT in declaration
Message-ID: <47494D0B.2020701@gmail.com>

Hi,

For practical use it would be beneficial to be able to configure the 
ethercat slaves at run-time.

Product code,
Revision code
Physical start address
etc.

At the moment (based on the master-test example) the configuration 
happens as a global declaration which means the above parameters are 
"cooked" in at compile time.

Is there any manner change this behaviour?

Advice would be much appreciated.

Kind regards,

Roland Tollenaar.

Hi Roland,

In the current implementation, the slave database is built up from
statically declared objects. However, the actual configuration can in
principle be done dynamically, using the slaves present in the database.
However, as the current implementation does not automatically provide
unique logical addresses and physical addresses to multiple slaves of
the same type, the slave database must contain multiple configuration
instances of the same slave type, which is not practical if the
multiplicity of slaves of the same type can be high.

I have written a simple c-app -called ec_config- that first reads the
actual layout (product- and revision codes) from the connected hardware,
and next generates a c-file with the necessary configuration data for
this hardware. Off course, the real-time app needs to be (re)compiled
including the generated file, but only once for a specific hardware
layout. Ec_config could also easily generate "standard" slave databases
from which every hardware system that fits this database could be
dynamically configured at run-time (e.g. if we would put five EL_5101
slaves in the database with different addresses as automatically
generated by ec_config, we could have up to five EL_5101 slaves in our
hardware). At the moment, configuration data is implemented for EK1100,
EL1014, EL1008, EL2004, EL2008, EL3102, EL4132 and EL5101. With the
current implementation, this is as close as I can get to dynamic
run-time configuration.

I think it would be nice if someone could modify EML to automatically
provide unique addresses to different slaves of the same type. That
would allow us to dynamically configure from a small static slave
database (which was maybe the idea of the original authors?).

Hi,

For practical use it would be beneficial to be able to configure the 
ethercat slaves at run-time.

Product code,
Revision code
Physical start address
etc.

At the moment (based on the master-test example) the configuration 
happens as a global declaration which means the above parameters are 
"cooked" in at compile time.

Is there any manner change this behaviour?

Advice would be much appreciated.

Kind regards,

Roland Tollenaar.

Dear all,

 

I've read several threads on the list about CoE and the lack of it in
the current EML implementation.

 

Is there still a way to set parameters on a slave, e.g. the FIR filter
parameter on the analog-out EL3102 slave?

 

Best regards, Rene'

Sorry, off course I meant: analog-IN EL3102...

Patches are welcome!

It was the idea indeed, but we've never gotten to implementation.

I'm not familiar with the particular module.  I'd suggest sniffing the
output from twincat and sending the necessary raw messages to the
module if you don't want to implement CoE on top of the current stack.

As a side note: did anyone already have a look at the CoE part of the
stack so he could make an estimate of how much time it would take to
implement CoE?
