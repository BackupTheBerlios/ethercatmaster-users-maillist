I once had a private conversation with somebody (he was Dutch too) who had already done it and told me it was a minor effort.  Unfortunately, it was never contributed back and I don't know whether he's subscribed to the mailinglist.

&gt;<i> I mention that we are not strictly interested in hard real-time in most of

The port above was non-realtime IIRC.
