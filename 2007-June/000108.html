A bit, I would say &quot;a lot&quot; :-)

I would suggest you to replace the slave code at the top of
master_test.cpp by the header code Tom sent in his email yesterday.
That way your master test program is going to recognise far more
slaves than it does now.
Eventually, I think this should become (in a first step) a eml header
file (something like beckhoff_slaves_config.hpp)
Patches are welcome :-)

See Jan's note about it.

</I>
There truly are 10 slaves in your network (there's only one buscoupler
who has a &quot;physical&quot; ethernet connection though)

&gt;<i> Very obviously it fails on trying to set the 4102 to operational

</I>
Exactly, so as a matter of fact, EML does exactly what you ask it
right now (see above to get one step further).


&gt;<i> EtherCAT AL: Ring contains 10 slaves
</I>&gt;<i> EEPROM busy
</I>&gt;<i> EEPROM busy
</I>
These eeprom busy errors typically happen when the slave doesn't react
fast enough to a particular request.  The master then retries a fixed
number of times, before giving up.

&gt;<i> AL creating SlaveHandler: pos=0, adr=0x3e9, Prod. Code=0x44c2c52, rev=0x10000
</I>
This one was recognised

&gt;<i> EtherCAT_SlaveDb: No such Config, returning NULL!
</I>
This one not, but it might be if you use Tom's code (as stated
above).  IIRC, for your analog input module, you'll have to follow
Tom's guidelines though

[...]
&gt;<i> EtherCAT_SlaveDb: No such Config, returning NULL!
</I>&gt;<i> EC_AL Warning: No such slave in db, creating dummy slave
</I>&gt;<i> AL creating SlaveHandler: pos=9, Product Code=0x10243052, rev=0x0
</I>&gt;<i> AL: resetting FMMUs
</I>&gt;<i> AL: resetting SMs
</I>&gt;<i> AL: Setting all slaves in init mode
</I>&gt;<i> Getting slave handler
</I>&gt;<i> Setting EK1100 to OP STATE
</I>&gt;<i> EK1100 succesfully set in OP STATE
</I>&gt;<i> Getting slave handler
</I>&gt;<i> EtherCAT_AL: No such slave, returning NULL
</I>&gt;<i> Setting EL4102 to OP STATE
</I>&gt;<i> Segmentation fault
</I>
As stated before, this is due to Tom's code that currently doesn't
check if the slave pointer is NULL.

All together, it seems like everything is working properly (i.e.~as
expected given the source code :)!
Best regards,

Klaas
