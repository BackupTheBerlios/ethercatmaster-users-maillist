<PRE>HI Tom,

The slaves all go into operational state it seems. At least all those
I configure, I do not have the correct parameters for the EL4132 so
that one is still not working. But what worries me is the address
0x0F00 in the configuration as I am using it in the below code.


///SlaveConfig EL2004(4) [Digital Output]
EtherCAT_FMMU_Config fmmu_config_EL2004_4(1);
EC_FMMU fmmu0_EL2004_4(0x0001000B,1,4,7,0x0F00,0,false,true,true);
EtherCAT_PD_Config pd_config_EL2004_4(1);
EC_SyncMan syncman0_EL2004_4(0x0F00,1,EC_QUEUED,EC_WRITTEN_FROM_MASTER,false,true,false,false,false,false,EC_FIRST_BUFFER,true);
EtherCAT_SlaveConfig
EC_EL2004_4(0x7d43052,0x100000,0x03ef,&amp;fmmu_config_EL2004_4,&amp;pd_config_EL2004_4);

In your class code you call the address that is given in the above
snippet as 0x0F00 the &quot;Fixed address&quot; and as you see it is not the
same as the &quot;physical address&quot; given in the committing call of the
salve config. Now my question is: Is there a difference and if so
what? And ifthere is a difference, how do I figure out what the &quot;Fixed
address&quot; is supposed to be? At the moment all configurations (8 in
total) use 0x0F00 and that seems to work.

Also why does it not make any difference to the functioning if I
change the &quot;fixed address&quot; (in this case 0x0F00) to be the same as the
physical address.

I have also written to ETG (when I assumed you were on holiday) to try
find out more about the addressing and address spaces. The
documentation available about ethercat even for a reputable member of
the ETG such as myself, is well, sparse.

Finally, if I my dump all questions here, my current problem is that I
cannot figure out from you examples how to read access  the EL 1014
and how to write the digital outputs to the EL2004. Do you have code
examples for the list showing how this is done using the EML?


Kind regards,

(And thanks very very much for the reply without which progress I have
found is slow)

Roland

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Tom,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry for the tremendous delay. I can only work on this in stolen hours.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have managed to improve matters a bit wrt the situation I sketched
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; previously. I was forgetting to commit the configuration settings with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the call set_conf.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However I did have the addressing wrong.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I do understand I think what you are saying about the start addresses.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; i am posting as i think it should be. Could you please check, confirm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and let us know where I am getting things wrong?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Everything seems to be right. I can't find a mistake in the addressing.
</I>&gt;<i> Have you tested this configuration? Can you put these modules in
</I>&gt;<i> Operational State?
