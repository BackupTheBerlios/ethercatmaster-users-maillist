</I>The logical addresses are used when sending processdata to the modules. 
Every module writes/reads data to/from the logical address that has been 
assigned to him. So every single module must have another logical 
address, to avoid conflicts. When assigning logical addresses, you must 
make sure that you don't use an address that's already been used. For 
example: the processdata of an EL4102 is 4 byte long, when you assign 
the logical address 0x1000 to that module, the addresses 0x1000 to 
0x1003 are being used by that module. The start-bit is 0 and the 
stop-bit is 7 since 4 whole bytes are being used. (The start-bit reverse 
to the first used byte (0x1000) and the stop-bit reverse to the last 
used byte (0x1003). So the next address that may be used for another 
module is 0x1004. The processdata of an EL2004 module is only 4 bit 
long. In this example, you can use address 0x1004. Because only 4 bits 
have to be used, the length is 1, the start-bit is 0 and the stop-bit is 
3. The last 4 bits of address 0x1004 can still be used for another 
module. The start-bit of that module module would be 4 in this case.

So in your case, you must assign a new logical address to the 3rd 
module, the start-bit shall be 0, the stop-bit 3.

The physical addresses are the addresses of the modules' memory itself. 
Those are the same for every module of the same type.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or might my problem be else-where?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is it possible to suggest what I am possibly wrong from the above? I 
</I>&gt;<i> cannot post my code snippet now (don';t have access to the code from 
</I>&gt;<i> here). 
</I>It's possible that the configurations of the SM are wrong to. If you can 
access your code and post it with a description of the used modules, it 
would be easier for me to see what's wrong with your configuration.
