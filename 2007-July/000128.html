</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In your class code you call the address that is given in the above
</I>&gt;<i> snippet as 0x0F00 the &quot;Fixed address&quot; and as you see it is not the
</I>&gt;<i> same as the &quot;physical address&quot; given in the committing call of the
</I>&gt;<i> salve config. Now my question is: Is there a difference and if so
</I>&gt;<i> what? And ifthere is a difference, how do I figure out what the &quot;Fixed
</I>&gt;<i> address&quot; is supposed to be? At the moment all configurations (8 in
</I>&gt;<i> total) use 0x0F00 and that seems to work.
</I>
I think you're confusing the fixed station address with the physical 
start address. Every module (station) has a different address which can 
be used to address the module. This address is only used during 
configuration. In your example above (EL2004_4) the fixed station 
address is 0x03ef. It's the 3rd argument of the EtherCAT SlaveConfig. As 
you'll see in the rest of your code, every module has a different fixes 
station address.

The address 0x0F00 you're referring to, isn't the fixes station address, 
it's the physical start address. It's a memory address of the module. 
For the EL2004 module: data written to this address is controlling the 
output of the module. You never write directly to this address, you 
write to a logical address, in your example above: 0x0001000B. The FMMU 
(in combination with the Synchronisation Manager) writes this data to 
the memory of the module, in this case 0x0F00. The FMMU needs to know 
both the logical start address and the physical start address since it 
connects both addresses. The Synchronisation Manager makes sure that 
data isn't read from or written to the physical memory address (0x0F00) 
at the same time. As you see, the Synchronisation Manager also needs 
this address, so is knows which part of the memory it has to synchronise

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also why does it not make any difference to the functioning if I
</I>&gt;<i> change the &quot;fixed address&quot; (in this case 0x0F00) to be the same as the
</I>&gt;<i> physical address.
</I>
These two address have nothing to do with each other, so it doesn't make 
ad difference if they're the same or not.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have also written to ETG (when I assumed you were on holiday) to try
</I>&gt;<i> find out more about the addressing and address spaces. 
</I>
Indeed, I was on a little holiday :-)

&gt;<i> The documentation available about ethercat even for a reputable member of
</I>&gt;<i> the ETG such as myself, is well, sparse.
</I>
This documentation on ETG just describes the EherCAT protocol. The 
documentation from the Beckhoff modules has to come from Beckhoff itself.
For each module, there's a little information on there website, but I 
tollaly agree it's very sparse. I had to figure most things out with 
TwinCAT in combination with a network sniffer.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, if I my dump all questions here, my current problem is that I
</I>&gt;<i> cannot figure out from you examples how to read access  the EL 1014
</I>&gt;<i> and how to write the digital outputs to the EL2004. Do you have code
</I>&gt;<i> examples for the list showing how this is done using the EML?
</I>
I'll explain this in your other mail

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kind regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (And thanks very very much for the reply without which progress I have
</I>&gt;<i> found is slow)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Tom,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry for the tremendous delay. I can only work on this in stolen 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hours.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I have managed to improve matters a bit wrt the situation I sketched
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; previously. I was forgetting to commit the configuration settings with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the call set_conf.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; However I did have the addressing wrong.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I do understand I think what you are saying about the start addresses.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; i am posting as i think it should be. Could you please check, confirm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; and let us know where I am getting things wrong?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Everything seems to be right. I can't find a mistake in the addressing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Have you tested this configuration? Can you put these modules in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Operational State?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
