No, which sentence or paragraph did you understand that from.
Currently there are two options

- EML + eCos (using the network stack provided with eCos)
- EML + Xenomai + RTNET

The latter one was used to drive the 2-dof table.

In-Reply-To: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0704261545110.14720@ampere.labo01.fmtc.be>
Message-ID: <OFF1BA7D23.F4AC4AFC-ONC12572D5.003BD8B1-C12572D5.003EAC33@MAIL.DE.FESTO.NET>

Hello,

I have still the same problem! My ethercat master cycle times is about in
millisecounds, but it should be in microsecounds (I use the EVA-Board and
eCos to measure the cycle times). On the EVA-Board, I connected the input
pins with the output pins. So the first frame set an input pin and the next
frame reads the output pin. My oscilloscop is measured the time how long a
pin is set! Thats my application.

- cycle time = period between two frames

static void timeMeasure( cyg_addrword_t )
{
    unsigned char msg[2] = { 0x00, 0x00 };
    unsigned int counter = 0;

    // EtherCAT_Master zeiger holen
    EtherCAT_Master * EM = EtherCAT_Master::instance();
    while(true)
    {
        // Signal setzen
        cyg_thread_delay( (cyg_tick_count_t)0 );
        if( counter >= 0 )
        {
            if( msg[0] == 0x00 )
            {
                msg[0] = 0x01;
            }
            else if( msg[0] == 0x01 )
            {
                msg[0] = 0x00;
            }
            counter = 0;
        }
        counter++;
        // Signal r?cksetzen
        EM->txandrx_PD( 2, msg );
    }
}

1.) I send process data (0x01, 0x00). These process datas set an input pin
and the appropriate output pin (Because the input pin and the output pin
are connected together)
2.) The next process data frame sends (0x00,0x00) and fetchs the output
process data.
3.) Now I measured how long the pin is set! The time is in millisecounds.
But it should be in microsecounds.

=> So i have measured how long it takes to sending two frames in a row!!!

Can you test this Thread/Application with your Master and your EVA-Board!
What cylce times (How long is the period between two frames) do you get?

How does _reading_ the value of the output pin toggle it?

Are you running this function in a high priority thread?

How can you set an input pin?

This is not an application, it is merely a function.

Hi,

I have a linux/xenomai/rtnet installation prepared with the intention
of using EML. I have downloaded the EML tarball but see no
instructions to install on xenomai. The home site suggests a
xenomai-EML beta versions but I cannot find the location.

Could anyone help?

Thanks,

You can find the the xenomai-EML version in SVN:  
https://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=6087
The install instructions are described in the README

Can you be more specific?  What goes wrong exactly?

Since we consider the EML port still to be in, I would _strongly_
advise you trying to use SVN, that will make things far more easy if
we discover and fix errors you might encounter...

If SVN _really_ (REALLY?) doesn't work, I've exported the latest trunk at

I don;t understand the instructions? :) Either its very simple and I am 
overlooking something, or it is very complicated. What does not help is 
that I am completely unfamiliar with the SVN concept.

Thanks, downloaded it for a quick start. I am more than happy to use the 
SVN mechanism but will need some help there. I can get into he trunk and 
view the files but I don't understand how to download them.

Once you have an svn client, it boils down to

cd /my/sources/
svn checkout http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/ethercatmaster/trunk eml-trunk

Ah. Ok this changes matters. What is the best SVN client to use and

Hi,

I have managed to compile the rtnet trunk version successfully (or so it

I need some advice on how to install the library (ldconfig under linux 
was it not? And in what directory must I place libeml.so?)

And on how to test it.

I have not yet got an ethernet slave.

Thanks in advance.

Kind regards,

Just to make sure I am not going to try the impossible I have listed

If there are any modules that are unsupported by EML please let me know.

Then you cannot really test it ATM.  We have no virtual slave

EML does not support beckhoff modules "out of the box" (yet).  Tom is
(or has already, I haven't check) preparing a "README" file that
specifies how to get started with a particular module.  Tom, can you
provide an update of the status of that file?

[please note that you are very lucky I happen to understand some
dutch :-), however please use english only on this ML]
However, the fact your first module specifies it is a coupler for
CAN-open somehow worries me a bit, so this might be "trying the
impossible"?

Hi,

> how about running "make install"?
Ah, perhaps update the README in the package with this wisdom. I
simply put it in
/usr/local/eml-trunk/build_rtnet/src. Which is kind of where it ends
up in if one unpacks in /usr/local.

Then ldconfig <above path>.

But will try the make install thing soon.

Pity. Just to get some feedback (I am still absolutely out of touch
with this ethercat everything helps)

I start rtnet in loopback mode shich seems to be successful. Then run
the master_test.


root at slax:/usr/local/eml-trunk/build_rtnet/tests/rtnet# ./master_test rteth0
Socket created: socket id: 896
Got interface: index: 0
Attach netif

Master initializing

low_level_txandrx: failed: MAX_TRIES_TX: Giving up
DLL::txandrx() Error
Error sending counter frame
Something went wrong while scanning network
EtherCAT_AL:: Can't init network
Getting slave handler
EtherCAT_AL: No such slave, returning NULL
Setting EK1100 to OP STATE
Segmentation fault

Does this look like normal behavior given nothing attached to the
network adaptor?
I assume the program Master_test IS finding the library lib_eml.so though.


Kind regards,

Roland

ldconfig is only necessary if you're building a dynamic library and
changed the default installation path (but this is out of scope on eml-users)

Yes, it is.  This seems likes Tom forgot to exit the program after
initializing the network went wrong.  What you're actually see is the
fact that no slave responds to the master, so the AL can't init the
network.  After that, it should abort further effort.
Without looking at the code, I suppose getting the slave handler now
returns a null pointer, with the above consequence :-)

Great. Thanks.

Oh, I already fixed id, but forgot to put that in my previous reply
:-(

#  svn commit -m "add make install" README

Committed revision 29.

Not succesfully I guess (since you won't have the same slaves as in
the example, but you should see a different output at least (ic. the
master should detect some slave)

You will probably need a real slave (and not a bus coupler) in order
to do something really useful...

master_test, together with Tom's "getting started" document seems like
the best place to start.

We've got almost an exact setup like this in our lab (the only
differency being the 4132 module, because we misordered that one and got
analog output between 0 and 10 V instead :-) to drive a 2DOF XY table,
so you shouldn't expect any problems here.

For his master thesis, Tom integrated this with the orocos
<http://www.orocos.org> device interface
<http://www.orocos.org/stable/documentation/rtt/v1.2.x/api/html/group__DeviceInterface.html>,
so you can make abstraction of using ethercat.  But expect a
cleanup version of that code in the repository no earlier than august.

I'm still learning new stuff every day :-)

Hmmm this IS a stroke of luck. Will I find the master-test source 
showing rather accurately how to address my slave then?

Looks very interesting will keep an eye on it.
