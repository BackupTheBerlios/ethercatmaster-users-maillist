Hallo,

Is there anybody who has already used the CANopen functionality ? Is it
working ?

I didn't find any documentation about the usage of this functionality.
Is there anybody who can share an example or give som more information ?

Best regards,

Frederik

Hi,
I just find out the project. I recently use Orocos RTT toolkit, and some post
link to the EML project.
Beckoff (french reseller more exactly) says that a soluce is going to be
elaborated in the next days, concerning the license problem. Any exciting news
about it ??

Thanks a lot.
Manfred
