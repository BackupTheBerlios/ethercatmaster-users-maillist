&gt;<i> Some questions regarding the EtherCAT master:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.Can it be ported to  WinCE 6 or Other Win32 API RTOS?
</I>
Yes, IIRC I already had a private email conversation in the past with somebody
which has it done already.  Never saw code though.  I don't know if
he follows this mailing list and is willing to share his code?

&gt;<i> 2. What is the fastest PDO cycle that you've reached with it and under
</I>&gt;<i> what OS?
</I>
We never really went &quot;all the way&quot;, but we have given demos using
xenomai with a PDO cycle of 10 kHz.
It's been a very long time since we've used the eCos port, but given
appropriate hardware, that should work on eCos too.

&gt;<i> 3. Is XML parsing done on target?
</I>
There is no XML parsing in the code currently, and if there would be
(there have been some mails on the mailing list about this, but again,
we never saw code), it would be on master side

&gt;<i> 4. Is it all open source code?
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> 5. How is it decoupled from the main firmware?
</I>
I think I don't understand your question here.  It implements only
master functionality and respects the standard, so it's not coupled to
(ethercat) firmware.

&gt;<i> 6. Are there any special HAL support for specific Ethernet chips?
</I>
We rely on HAL support from
- available ethernet HW drivers in the eCos project for eCos
- available ethernet HW drivers from the RTnet project for Xenomai

So it's the OS that delivers us the network drivers.

&gt;<i> 7. If yes, how can this layer be ported to other OS?
</I>&gt;<i> 8.  Could you please explain the GPL lisence policy ?
</I>
What exactly is unclear about it?

&gt;<i> 9. Would you consider slave implementation on DSP as a project ?
</I>
FMTC is currently not actively working on the project anymore (we do
use the code in some of our projects ourselves).
The source code is there for the community to use (and improve).

Best regards,

Klaas Gadeyne
